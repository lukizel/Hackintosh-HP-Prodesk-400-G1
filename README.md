## Improvements
- Use https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh to optimize CPU power management
- After installation, open terminal and use the command `sudo spctl --master-disable` to allow apps from unidentified developers
- ACPI sleep is working. You can wake up the computer using the keyboard. If any issues with sleep arise, open terminal and use the command `sudo pmset -a standby 0` to resolve issues with waking up.
## Installation

### First-time installation
First of all, go to the UEFI settings and disable the serial port. Upgrade the BIOS to the newest possible version (currently the newest version is version no. [00.02.56, Rev.A](https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp96001-96500/sp96015.exe) which was released on the 30th of April 2019)
To install it, download the Olarila distro image from their forums, burn it to a USB Stick with Etcher (under Linux) or Win32DiskImager (under Windows) and replace the Clover folder entirely with the folder from this repo.

### Issues
- VGA Display output isn't working
- If you are going to install Catalina instead of Mojave, be aware that the TV app and Sidecar don't work.
- I'm not sure about 4K, but according to Donw35 from the InsanelyMac forums it doesn't work.
- While installing, make sure your USB Stick, keyboard and mouse are attached to USB2.0 ports instead of USB3.0. 3.0 ports do work fine in the system itself, though.
## A reward

The entirety of this project is available free of charge, but you can give me a small reward (if you want to).
